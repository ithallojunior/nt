title: nt - A simple note taking app for the terminal

---

Simple note taking app for the terminal. It is currently written in python and
I might in the future rewrite in shell script as it mostly binds commands from the
terminal itself.


## To do list
 
  + Github  backup support;
  + Image support;
  + Improve interface;
  + A proper install guide;
  + Rewrite in shell script (maybe).

I hope it is useful to you. Enjoy it :)

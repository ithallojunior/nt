title: nt - A simple note taking app for the terminal

---

Simple note taking app for the terminal. It is currently written in python and
I might in the future rewrite in shell script as it mostly binds commands from the
terminal itself.

## Installing

Edit the **configs** file to your taste and run  *python setup.py install* 
(you will need to create the alias manually) or 
*python setup.py full_install* (be careful, it adds to your rc folder).


## To do list
 
  + Github  backup support;
  + Rewrite in shell script (maybe).

I hope it is useful to you. Enjoy it :)
